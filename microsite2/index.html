  <h1>Lake Catherine State Park</h1>
  <h3>Hot Springs, Arkansas</h3>
  <img src="assets/imgs/Lake_Catherine_State_Park_001.jpg" class="main-image" alt="Image of Lake Catherine">
  <p>This peaceful park is located on Lake Catherine, one of five lakes in the beautiful Ouachita Mountain region. The only full-service marina on the lake is here at the park and open in the summertime for bait, snacks/drinks, and fuel. The park also includes a launch ramp, pavilion, picnic sites, playgrounds, and a well-marked trail that leads to a waterfall.</p>
  <p>The park has 20 fully equipped cabins, including one two-bedroom cabin with a patio overlooking the water and private access to the lake from its own fishing pier. There are also many native stone and wood buildings on-site. The history of these structures dates back to the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) in the 1930s. The park offers 70 campsites (47 Class AAA and 23 Class B), six primitive tent sites, and one Rent-A-Yurt. Many of these sites are on the lakeshore. Park interpreters offer hikes, lake tours, and programs year-round.</p>
  <p>Guided horseback rides are offered seasonally. Open daily at 10 a.m. from Memorial Day weekend through Labor Day weekend. Fall & Winter: Open 10 a.m. Saturday and Sunday through Thanksgiving. Though not required, reservations are recommended and to make <b>horseback riding reservations</b> only call <a href="tel:5018444176" class="tele">501-844-4176</a>. They cannot answer questions about the park. <b>$50</b> per person including tax. Please pay at the stables. Group rates are available.</p>
