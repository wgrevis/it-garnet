        <h2 id="main-heading">Thoughts on Progressive Enhancment</h2>
        <p>I previously had read this article and after dicussing this in class I have a few thoughts I wouldl like to share. I really enjoyed this concept when I first read about it, and ill be honest when I say it's not something I always consider. I really enjoyed the anology in the first reading that was used about a peanut butter M&M. The outter shell is like the coating (HTML) and then the chocolate is like the (CSS) and finally the gooey peanut butter inside is the (JavaScript).</p>
        <p>It's not a super difficult concept to understand, but I feel like it's one that is difficult to constantly follow. That's why I am glad I am realizing the importance of this now as I head deeper into this field.</p>

        <p><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-progressive-enhancement-and-why-it-matters-e80c7aaf834a/">Here</a> is an external article I found on Progressive Enhancment, I really enjoyed reading this one because I liked how Dubey, explained exactly what PE is. The most intresting part was the PE strategy he listed which was as follows: "Basic content should be accessible to all web browsers
          Basic functionality should be accessible to all web browsers
          Sparse, semantic markup contains all content
          Enhanced layout is provided by externally linked CSS
          Enhanced behavior is provided by unobtrusive, externally linked JavaScript
          End-user web browser preferences are respected"</p>

          <p>Dubey does a great job at explaining exaclty how this stragey works and how cruicial it is on the web. As well as how this all works togetehr to ensure stability across the internet, of course, on all pages that follow Progressive Enhancment.</p>
