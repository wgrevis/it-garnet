        The student life at UA Little Rock is typical of public universities
        in the United States. It is characterized by student-run organizations
        and affiliation groups that support social, academic, athletic, and
        religious activities and interests. Some of the services offered by
        the UA Little Rock Office of Campus Life are intramural sports and
        fitness programs, diversity programs, leadership development, peer
        tutoring, student government association, student support programs
        including groups for non-traditional and first-generation students, a
        student-run newspaper, and fraternity and sorority life. The proximity
        of the UA Little Rock campus to downtown Little Rock enables students
        to take advantage of a wide array of recreational, entertainment,
        educational, internship, and employment opportunities that are not
        available anywhere else in Arkansas.[20]

            Two Little Rock teams that do not compete in the Sun Belt are the
            women's swimming and diving team (Missouri Valley Conference) and
            wrestling (Pac-12 Conference), neither of which the Sun Belt
            sponsors. Wrestling is the school's newest sport, starting in 2019,
            and is the first Division I program in Arkansas.
